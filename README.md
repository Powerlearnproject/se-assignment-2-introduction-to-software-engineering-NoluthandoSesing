# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and tools to the development and maintenance  of high quality software systems. It includes the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?I differes from traditional programming in that it is focused on a structured approache to the development of software,focuses on the reliability,the quality and maintainability.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.Life cycle consists of the following phases: 1. Requiremnts=In this phase,the developer gathers and documents the needs of the user as well as what is required by the system.2 Analysis=Breaking down of the needs into manageable components and creatign a detailed design. 3. Design=In this phase you create high-level and detailed designs of the software archiitecture and user interface.4 Implementation:Writing the code and building software accprding the the specifications.5 testing= Running tests to ensure the software is of quality standards and is functional. 6 Deployment: Releasing the software to the users. 7 Maintenance=providing ongoing support,updates aand enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile models of software: Iterative and incremental development. Flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. Emphasis on collaboration and continius improvement. Suitable for projects with requiremnts that may change. 
Waterfall models of software:Sequential and linear development. Phases completed in a fixed order. Emphasis in the predictability and how it will be controlled. Suitable for projects with fixed requiremnts. 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.Requirements engineering is the process of defining,analyzing,documenting and maintaining of software requirements.It includes:1 Elicitation:gathering users needs and expectations. 2Analysis :breaking down requiremnts into smaller components.3 Specification:documenting requiremnts in a clear manner. 4 Validation:Verifying that requirements are complete and accurate. Requirements engineering is crucial in ensuring that the software meets the users needz,it is developed timeously and within a set budget.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?Modularity is the breaking down of softwarebinto much smalller and independent modules that have a specific role and interface. Modularity makes it easier to replace or update individual modules without affecting the whole system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?testing is the process of evaluating sogtware to make sure it meets the requirements and functions as it should. Types of testing are the following; 1 Unit testing:testing individual modules. 2 Intergration testing: testing how components work together.3 System testing:testing the entire software system. 4 acceptance testing: verify that software meets user requirements.Testing is important to ensure the quality of the software,if its reliable and it satisfies the user

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.:Software tools that assist software developers to manage changes to source code over time. They are important for tracking changes to code,files as well as other assets. Examples include : Git,Mercurial and subversion

Software Project Management

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Software project manager serves as a liasons between the development team and the stakeholders in a project.A software project managers key responsibilities are overseeing the planning,the execution and the delivery of the software.Project manager may face challenges in communication,poor planning and unrealistic deadlines. 

Software Maintenance:


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?It is the maintenance,up keepor modification of a software product. Different types of maintanence activities; corrective which is fxing defects,adaptive which is adapting to the environment,perfective hich is enhancing attributes as well as preventitive which is preventing problems.Maintenance is important so to modify and update software applications after deployments to fix and improve the system.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?Software engineers may face issues like the software they make hurting people,this applies to their actions too. They should be honest and trustworthy. They should implement robust authentification,encryption mechanisms to protect user data and prioritise security measures.
